# Analysis-On-Customer-Churn-

**Predicting Customer Churn For A Company in the Telecommunications Industry.** 

In this project, I will be following the data analysis pipeline and performing ETL on a customer churn dataset from a Telecommunications company taken from Kaggle.com. 

**Goal**: Predict the churn status of newly registered customers into the service based on they average monthly bill, monthly data usage (Gb), daytime call length (min), number of calls using the service per day, and finally the customers current churn status. 

Following the basic process of the data analysis pipeline, I will: 


1. Acquire the data 
2. Clean the data
3. Perform relevant statisical tests to learn more about the data and my goal 
4. Compare and constrast the performance of various supervised meachine learning models on the data. 
5. Summarize and report results
